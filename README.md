# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Project Overview

Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

In this assignment, using the knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, to add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
